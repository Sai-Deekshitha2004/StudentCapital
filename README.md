## 💡 The Problem
The Indian education system teaches us to solve for "X," but not how to manage "₹." Most students use UPI for daily micro-transactions but lack the financial literacy to understand inflation, SIPs, or asset allocation. **StudentCapital** bridges this gap using AI.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. The "Active Tracker" Dashboard
*   **UPI Micro-Spend Summary:** Automatically aggregates small daily transactions (₹10–₹100) common in student life.
*   **Daily Allowance Widget:** A dynamic AI-driven tool that tells you: *"To stay within budget, you can spend ₹350 today."*
*   **Real-Time Balance Overview:** A side-by-side view of "Bank Balance" vs. "Disposable Income."

### 2. "Bill & Expense" Manager
*   **Subscription Audit:** Tracks common Indian services like Jio/Airtel, SonyLIV, Disney+ Hotstar, and Zomato Gold.
*   **Social Splitter:** A professional "Group Expense" feature for splitting café bills or trips (Manali/Goa) with a "Send UPI Link" button.
*   **Hyper-Local Category Tags:** Specific tags like "Campus Mess," "Commute/Auto," and "Exam Fees."

### 3. "Investment Accelerator"
*   **SIP Starter:** A simulator showing how a ₹500 monthly SIP can grow by age 30.
*   **Digital Gold Ledger:** A simple UI for buying fractional "Digital Gold" starting at just ₹10.
*   **Risk Profiling:** Helps students choose between Equity (High Risk) and Debt/FDs (Low Risk).

### 4. "Knowledge Hub" (Financial Literacy)
*   **The Biryani Index:** A visual tool explaining inflation by showing how the price of a plate of Biryani has risen over 5 years.
*   **Cyber-Safety:** AI-powered modules on avoiding UPI Phishing and fraudulent "Quick Loan" apps.
*   **The Rule of 72:** An interactive tool to see how many years it takes to double your money in India.

---

## 🧠 Technical Implementation (Google AI Studio)
The "Intelligence" of the app is powered by **Gemini** via **Google AI Studio**:
*   **System Instructions:** Configured a "Savvy Financial Mentor" persona to simplify complex SEBI regulations and market jargon.
*   **Structured Output (JSON Mode):** Used to convert raw UPI transaction descriptions into structured data for the dashboard.
*   **Logic Orchestration:** AI evaluates the **50/30/20 Rule** (50% Essentials, 30% Lifestyle, 20% Investing) to provide personalized advice.
